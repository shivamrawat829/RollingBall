Thanks for purchasing UET Particles Kit!

Package Contents:
=================
- UETools/Meshes
- UETools/Textures
- UETools/Materials

UETools/Meshes:
===============
50 primitive meshes for prototyping and particle systems, some of them works best with noise functions, some of them with symetric textures.

UETools/Textures/[QUALITY]:
===========================
/A01 - Basic shape for use with additive shader and color multiply
/A02 - Shape with style for use with additive shader and color multiply
/A03 - Shape with style for use with additive shader and color multiply
/A04 - Shape with style for use with additive shader and color multiply
/Default - Standalone textures without any style
/T01 - Shape with style for use with translucent shader and color multiply
/T02 - Shape with style for use with translucent shader, contains color variants

UETools/Materials/[QUALITY]:
============================
Materials with additive/translucent shaders, ready to use. Same structure as UETools/Textures.

Naming conventions:
===================
UETools/[ASSET_TYPE]/[QUALITY]/[STYLE]/[ASSET_NAME]

[ASSET_TYPE]   - Materials/Textures
[QUALITY]      - at the moment, HQ_256(texture 256x256 pixels) / LQ_64(texture 64x64 pixels)
[STYLE]        - A like Additive shader, T like Translucent shader + Counter == A01, A02, etc.
[ASSET_NAME]   - [CATEGORY]_[COUNTER]_[STYLE](_[Color])(_[M])
                 - [CATEGORY] - Circle/Star/...
                 - [COUNTER]  - 01, 02, ...
                 - [STYLE]    - again, A = Additive, T = Translucent
                 - [Color]    - only in styles with color variants, Blue/Cyan/Green/Pink/Purple/Red/Yellow
                 - [M]        - This is material

Remember! There is no rule how to use textures, try any shader/shape/color/mesh combination you want. You may be suprised!
